### Overview

I made this just for fun. It uses Discord interaction features to let you order a pizza in real life. When ordering, sensitive data such as credit card details and you address should <strong>not</strong> be sent in a message, so fill out `Config.cs` if you want to try this out for yourself. I also don't suggesting editing this project to let a user input that sensitive data.

### How to use

Since ordering pizza involves sensitive data such as your address and card details, only one person is allowed to use this bot: you. If you really want to use it, make a new bot in the Discord developer center, fill out the `Config.cs` file, invite the bot to your server, and run it.

### To Run
1. Make sure you have [.NET 5.0](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/5.0)   
2. Fill out `Config.cs`  
3. Run `dotnet restore`  
4. Run `dotnet run`  

### Other Menu Items

I didn't bother adding other stuff such as sandwiches and drinks (that why those buttons are disabled).
