# Dominos Discord

Order Domino's directly within Discord. Domino

### How to use

Since ordering pizza involves sensitive data such as your address and card details, only one person is allowed to use this bot: you. If you really want to use it, make a new bot in the Discord developer center, fill out the `Config.cs` file, invite the bot to your server, and run it.
